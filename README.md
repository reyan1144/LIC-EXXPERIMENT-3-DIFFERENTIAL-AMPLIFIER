## DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER  
A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting any signals that are common to both inputs. It is a fundamental building block in analog circuits and is widely used in operational amplifiers (op-amps), instrumentation amplifiers, and other signal-processing applications.
# KEY FEATURES  
1.  The output can be either a single voltage (referenced to ground) or a differential voltage (difference between two outputs).
2.  The amplifier rejects signals that are common to both inputs (common-mode signals), such as noise or interference.
3.  It provides high voltage gain for the difference between the two input signals.
# APPLICATIONS  
1. Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps): The input stage of an op-amp is typically a differential amplifier.
2. Instrumentation Amplifiers: Used in precision measurement systems to amplify small differential signals.
3. Noise Cancellation: Rejects common-mode noise in communication systems.
4. Analog Comparators: Compares two input voltages and produces an output based on their difference.

# ADVANTAGES  
1. High common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).
2. Improved noise immunity.  
3. Suitable for amplifying small differential signals in the presence of large common-mode noise.

# LIMITATIONS  
1. Requires matched components (e.g., resistors, transistors) for optimal performance.
2. Limited by the common-mode input voltage range.

A basic differential amplifier can be implemented using transistors (BJT or MOSFET) or op-amps.
